programming,moonfish: a ~2000 Elo python chess engine,"Moonfish is a chess engine I developed in Python a few years ago to understand how engines work under the hood. The code favors simplicity and readability over performance optimization.

The engine implements:

* Negamax
* Layer-based Parallelization: Distributes work at specific search depths (L1P, L2P algorithms)
* Lazy SMP
* Move Ordering: MVV-LVA (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker)
* Null Move Pruning
* PeSTO Evaluation Function with Tapered Evaluation
* UCI protocol
* Integrates with lichess bot platform
* Web API
* Uses Cerebellum as opening book
* Endgame tablebases support
* [Distributed via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/moonfish/), you can access the engine from your custom python code, [check the README](https://github.com/luccabb/moonfish/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-usage)
* Bratko-Kopec test suite
* Custom test suite to ensure basic functionality. Not sure how much ELO it tests for, but if these tests are passing it your custom engine search implementation is likely not super off. If it does fail then your search algorithm \_likely\_ has a problem 
* You can control how the engine behaves via CLI arguments, \`moonfish --help\` to check all options.

On Performance:

* \~2000 Elo when tested against lichess stockfish bots.
   * it beats [stockfish lvl 5 \~2000 Elo](https://lichess.org/forum/general-chess-discussion/what-are-the-elo-ratings-for-stockfish-levels-4-5-6-7-and-8#8).
   * mostly loses to [stockfish lvl 6 \~2300 Elo](https://lichess.org/forum/general-chess-discussion/what-are-the-elo-ratings-for-stockfish-levels-4-5-6-7-and-8#8).
* When testing online on lichess against other engines it performs at \~1700 Elo
* The above is when running on a Macbook M1 Pro, this will vary based on hardware and parameters passed to the engine.
* No time control implemented—deeper searches take proportionally longer

For a list of resources and inspirations that helped shape Moonfish, check out the [references](https://github.com/luccabb/moonfish?tab=readme-ov-file#references) in the repository.",58,6,17-08-2025 10:48,luccabz,https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1msic8l/moonfish_a_2000_elo_python_chess_engine/

programming,Physics Hub - Open source project for student,"Hi everyone!  
I’m working on **Physics Hub**, an open-source project designed for students, curious minds, and enthusiasts who want to **learn physics in an interactive way.**

The idea is simple: instead of just reading formulas, you can **experiment with them directly** and learn from theoretical sources beyond the usual boring school textbook.

Each “chapter” of the platform contains a simulation (for example, a bouncing ball) and a control panel where you can adjust parameters in real time with sliders, inputs, and buttons.

The goal is to make studying physics:

* **Clearer** — by visualizing complex concepts directly
* **More fun** — by playing with parameters and instantly seeing the results
* **More accessible** — free and available online for everyone

This is a **non-profit project**, created for the student community. I'm looking for contributors that love this project.

If you’re curious, feel free to check it out:

I can give as much samples as anyone needs, just tell me something like 'convert this into your format, ""example message""'

Also my encoding works for any ascii characters even ones that aren't printable but none of my examples will use non-printable characters.

I want to add that this doesn't use any form of normal encryption and so it's not impossible without some special key or anything, you only need to know the way it's encoded and if you figure it out you can always get the original text no matter what.

also I linked some examples that I'm hosting on github. The format for them is:

programming,"Why `git diff` sometimes hangs for 10 seconds on Windows (it's Defender's behavioral analysis, and file exclusions won't help)","Originally posted in r/git.

**TL;DR:** Git commands like `git diff`, `git log`, and `git blame` randomly stall for 10 seconds on Windows. It's Microsoft Defender analyzing how Git spawns its pager through named pipes/PTY emulation - not scanning files, which is why exclusions don't help. After analysis, the same commands run instantly for \~30 seconds, then stall again. The fix: disable pagers for specific commands or pipe manually. This happens in PowerShell, Git Bash, and any terminal using Git for Windows.

# The Mystery

For months, I've been haunted by a bizarre Git performance issue on Windows 11:

* `git diff` hangs for 10 seconds before showing anything
* Running it again immediately: instant
* Wait a minute and run it again: 10 seconds
* But `git diff | cat` is ALWAYS instant

The pattern was consistent across `git log`, `git blame`, any Git command that uses a pager. After about 30 seconds of inactivity, the delay returns.

# The Investigation

# What Didn't Work

The fact that `git diff | cat` was always instant should have been a clue - if it was file cache or scanning, piping wouldn't help. But I went down the obvious path anyway:

* Added git.exe to Windows Defender exclusions
* Added less.exe to exclusions
* Excluded entire Git installation folder
* Excluded my repository folders

**Result**: No improvement. Still the same 10-second delay on first run.

# The First Clue: It's Not Just Git

Opening new tabs in Windows Terminal revealed the pattern extends beyond Git:

* PowerShell tab: always instant
* First Git Bash tab: 10 seconds to open
* Second Git Bash tab immediately after: instant
* Wait 30 seconds, open another Git Bash tab: 10 seconds again

This wasn't about Git specifically, it was about **Unix-style process creation on Windows**.

# The Smoking Gun: Process Patterns

Testing with different pagers proved it's pattern-based:

    # Cold start
    git -c core.pager=less diff    # 10 seconds
    git -c core.pager=head diff    # Instant! (cached)
    
    # After cache expires (~30 seconds)
    git -c core.pager=head diff    # 10 seconds
    git -c core.pager=less diff    # Instant! (cached)

The specific pager being launched doesn't matter. Windows Defender is analyzing **the pattern of HOW Git spawns child processes**, not which program gets spawned.

# The Real Culprit: PTY Emulation

When Git launches a pager on Windows, it:

1. Allocates a pseudo-terminal (PTY) pair
2. Sets up bidirectional I/O redirection
3. Spawns the pager with this complex console setup

This Unix-style PTY pattern triggers Microsoft Defender's behavioral analysis. When launching terminal tabs, Git Bash needs this same PTY emulation while PowerShell uses native console APIs.

# Why Exclusions Don't Work

**File exclusions** prevent scanning file contents for known malware signatures.

**Behavioral analysis** monitors HOW processes interact: spawning patterns, I/O redirection, PTY allocation. You can't ""exclude"" a behavior pattern.

Windows Defender sees: ""Process creating pseudo-terminal and spawning child with redirected I/O"" This looks suspicious. After 10 seconds of analysis, it determines: ""This is safe Git behavior"". Caches approval for around 30 seconds (observed in my tests).

# The 10-Second Timeout

The delay precisely matches Microsoft Defender's documented ""cloud block timeout"", the time it waits for a cloud verdict on suspicious behavior. Default: 10 seconds. \[1\]

# Test It Yourself

Here's the exact test showing the \~30 second cache:

    $ sleep 35; time git diff; sleep 20; time git diff; sleep 35; time git diff
    
    real    0m10.105s
    user    0m0.015s
    sys     0m0.000s
    
    real    0m0.045s
    user    0m0.015s
    sys     0m0.015s
    
    real    0m10.103s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.062s

There's a delay in the cold case even though there's no changes in the repo (empty output).

After 35 seconds: slow (10s). After 20 seconds: fast (cached). After 35 seconds: slow again.

# Solutions

# 1. Disable Pager for git diff

Configure Git to bypass the pager for diff:

    git config --global pager.diff false
    # Then pipe manually when you need pagination:
    # git diff | less

# 2. Manual Piping

Skip Git's internal pager entirely:

    git diff --color=always | less -R

# 3. Alias for Common Commands

    alias gd='git diff --color=always | less -R'

# 4. Switch to WSL2

WSL2 runs in a VM where Defender doesn't monitor internal process behavior

**Update 1:** Tested Git commands in PowerShell - they're **also affected** by the 10-second delay:

    PS > foreach ($sleep in 35, 20, 35) {
        Start-Sleep $sleep
        $t = Get-Date
        git diff
        ""After {0}s wait: {1:F1}s"" -f $sleep, ((Get-Date) - $t).TotalSeconds
    }
    After 35s wait: 10.2s
    After 20s wait: 0.1s
    After 35s wait: 10.3s

This makes sense: Git for Windows still creates PTYs for pagers regardless of which shell calls it. The workarounds remain the same - disable pagers or pipe manually.

**Update 2:** Thanks to u/bitzap\_sr for clarifying what Defender actually sees: MSYS2 implements PTYs using Windows named pipes. So from Defender's perspective, it's analyzing Git creating named pipes with complex bidirectional I/O and spawning a child, that's the suspicious pattern.

On top of data science/analyst stuff, I maintain/build our training website for around 500 employees (solo dev as well using React).

The down side? I work for Medicaid, and if you know what's going on in the United States you know Medicaid is having major cuts, and especially for 2026. We have laid off 300 people this year (so far). I was told ""You have nothing to worry about because your role is so niche"" but I still feel worried.

New job:

- Pay raise to 115k a year

- Still remote

- I would be working under my current boss who is transitioning to this new company (I have worked with him for 8 years, and the fact that my boss left this current job says something).

- 401k is comparable (3% match), health insurance is better and less cost, PTO is comparable.

- What I'm worried about: He is starting this new department from the ground up. I would be the only data/front-end website guy basically doing what I do in my current role.

datascience,Time series with value dependent lag,"I build models of factories that process liquids. Liquid flows through the factory in various steps and sits in tanks.

If the factory is in a steady state the residence times and lags are relatively easy to calculate.

If the flow rate goes up residence time goes down.

datascience,"Research Data Scientists without heavy coding backgrounds (stats, econ, etc), has LLM's improved your workflow?","I remember for a while there were many CS folks saying that Data Science has become software engineering, and that if you aren't fluent in software engineering fundamentals then you're going to fall behind. It became enough of a popular rhetoric that people said they preferred to hire a coder with some math knowledge than a math person with some coding knowledge. 

As a Statistician that works in Research Data Science with an average level of coding experience, enough to write my own code in notebooks, but translating it into a fully fleshed Python module with classes and functions was much more difficult for me. For a while I thought my lack of advanced software engineering knowledge would become a crutch in my career and as someone with a busy personal life I didn't want to spend that much time learning these fundamentals. Then, my company rolled out LLM's integrated into the software we use, like Visual Studio. Suddenly I'm able to create fully fleshed out modules from my notebooks in a flash. I can ask the LLM to write unit tests to test out how my code processes data or test its various subfunctions. I can use it to code up various types of models quickly to compare results.

datascience,What should my job title be,"I’ve been in my current role for ~5 months after finishing up my masters in geospatial data science. My official title is Energy Analyst, so essentially a data analyst role in the energy industry. 

I feel like the work I do is potentially beyond what is meant for the position (though I’m happy to be told otherwise if that’s not true) and am planning on asking for a title change and raise in the next few months. 

We have a weird set-up where we have a central IT team that supports ~12 implementation contractor teams that work with various utilities. The central IT team owns all of our data and does not allow any sort of read access or api to access data, and only exposes anything through SSRS reports. In theory, the IT team is meant to support a lot of our analytics, but historically they’ve done a pretty bad job at that so I was hired into one of the distributed teams to run their analytics and build out an internal IT capacity. So far that has included the following:

- Recreating a database from the SSRS extracts. So far this is only a few tables in a sqlite3 db so nothing crazy. 
- Developing optimization models in pyomo to inform program design.
- Lots of ad hoc analysis and reporting. Most of this can be done with some filtering and group-bys but has also included some iterative proportional fitting and other kind of ‘medium difficulty’ methods. 
- creating power bi dashboards as well as a couple java script maplibre-gl-js maps with complex symbology.
- we accept applications to our program via an online intake, where applicants fill out forms one by one. Most of these applicants submit tens to hundreds of these applications at once. I am working in parallel on a few different potential solutions to this: templates for batch uploading is the easy one, and a potential api integration to pull applications directly from applicant systems is another.
- looking into creating some llm-agents to automate very simply data extraction. I have already tried automating these processes via dom ids and such but haven’t gotten it to work reliably enough yet. My manager specifically asked for me to try agentic approaches to appease higher ups that we are implementing AI.

I’m not entirely sure where I fall in the landscape of data titles and would appreciate input. I mostly use python with a bit of power query and vanilla excel as well. Very little Java script (just for certain visualizations). Power bi. 

Edit to add- I also manage an intern-turned-part-time-employee that supports me in the above tasks basically at my own discretion ",6,10,14-08-2025 08:46,Tyrannosaurus_Secks,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mpp8sv/what_should_my_job_title_be/
datascience,Getting Master's worth it with T5 Bachelor's?,"As a bit of background, I have 2 years of work experience as a Data Scientist, and I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from a 'top' University: think MIT/Harvard/Princeton.

I'm currently employed. Making about $105k in total comp. I have a feeling I could be doing better compensation wise and even task wise so I've been considering applying to more jobs. 

I've noticed a lot of job postings seem to have a minimum requirement of at least a Master's degree, but I'm sort of hesitant to pursue this route right now for a few reasons. For one, master's are expensive, and I don't want to quit my job and go into debt. Secondly, if I were to pursue an online Master's degree, I'm not sure the available options would increase my signal. For example, does a MIT Math Bachelor's -> Texas AM Master's Data Science really boost the resume?

The only reason I'd get a Master's is for my love of learning, and I'd pursue something theoretical ML oriented and maybe transition into a more research-heavy or even quant role. But I'm not feeling this is an imminent or necessary next step for me.

Thank you to all those who responded. The replies were very reassuring.

After reading through the replies and reflecting on it, I realised the core of my struggle came from a specific fear that I would have to go through a rigorous coding interview, similar to what software engineers face.

I was picturing a scenario where I'd be given a problem and have to write perfect, memorised R code on the spot without any help. That pressure is what made me feel like I had to absorb every cheat sheet and learn all the syntax before I could even start a project. It created the syntax vs. projects Catch-22 that my original post was about.

I often get told ""learn data science by doing hands-on projects"" and then I get all fired up and motivated to learn, and then I open up R.... And then I stare at a blank screen because I don't know the syntax from memory. 

And then I tell myself I'm going to learn the syntax so that I can do projects, but then I get caught up creating folders for each function of dplyr and the subfunctions of that and cheat sheets for this.

And then I come across the advice that I shouldn't learn syntax for the sake of learning syntax - I should do hands on projects.

I need projects to learn syntax and I need syntax to start doing projects.

Edit - Thank you so much to all of you who have replied and I would respond to each one of you but I don't want to sound like a parrot.

The reassurance that you don't have to have absorbed every R cheat sheet before being a professional Data Scientist/Analyst is very much appreciated.

I'm a Director at my company. I'm in the meetings and helping set up the tools that cost people their jobs. Here's how they work:

1. Claude AI writes some code

2. The code gets passed to a developer for validation

3. Since the developer's ""just validating"", he can be replaced with an overseas contractor that'll work for a fraction of the pay

We've tracked the tools, and we haven't seen any evidence that having Claude take a crack at the code saves anybody any time - but it does let us justify replacing expensive employees with cheap overseas contractors.

datascience,"Burnout, disillusionment, and imposter syndrome after 1 year in DS. Am I just an API monkey? Reality check needed.","Hey folks,

I am about a year into my first data science job. It took roughly a year and more than 400 applications to land it, so the idea of another long search is scary.

Early on I worked with an internally built causal AI model that captures relationships for further analysis. I did not build the model. I ran experiments to make it more explainable and easier for others to use. I also built data orchestration pipelines using third party tools that are common in industry and cloud providers like AWS and GCP.

The last six months have shifted to LLM and NLP work. A lot of API calls, large text analysis. The next six months look even more LLM heavy since I am leading an internal tool build.

On paper there are wins:
- I have led projects and designed tools from scratch.
- My communication and client skills have improved.


My concerns:

- I am not doing much classical DS or rigorous modeling.
- LLM work often feels like API wrangling rather than technical depth.
- Work life balance is rough with frequent weekends.
- Even with a possible 5 to 10 percent raise (possibly within the next 6 months), the work likely stays the same.

I feel imposter syndrome and worry I am behind my peers on fundamentals and interview depth. I’m so burned out and honestly can’t tell if I’m just being a negative Nancy or if my concerns are legit. Am I shortchanging myself by thinking that I'm just not skilled enough? Idk


What I would love input on:

Am I building valuable skills for the DS market, or am I narrowing myself too much?

What types of companies or industries might value this mix of causal modeling, LLM work, and consulting style analysis?

If I want to keep doors open for more traditional DS or ML roles, what should I focus on learning now?

Portfolio ideas I can ship from my current work that would impress a hiring manager?

Would you ride out six months to finish the tool and try for a promotion, or start looking sooner?

Honest takes are very welcome.

I have two questions related unbalanced data in A/B testing. Would appreciate resources or thoughts. 

1. Usually when we perform A/B testing, we have 5-10% in treatment, after doing power analysis we get the sample size needed, we run tge experiment, by the time we get required sample size for treatment we get way more control samples, so now when we analyse, which samples do we keep in control group? For example by the time we collect 10k samples from treatment we might get 100k samples of control. So what to do now before performing t-test or any kinds of test? 
 (In ML we can downsample or over sample but what to do in causal side) 

2. Again similar question Lets say we are performing test on 50/50 but if one variant get way more samples as more ppl come through that channel and common for users, hiw do we segment users such as way? And again which samples we keep once we get way more sample than needed? 

I want to know how it is tackeled in day to day, and this thing happen frequently right? Or am i wrong? 

Also, what if you get sample size before expected time? (Like was thinking to run them for 2 weeks but got the required size in 10 days) Do you stop the experiment and start analyzing?

About to start my last semester for my masters in computer science, with a concentration in AI. I’m a veteran data scientist, this is more of a vanity degree and an ability to say “yes I do have a masters degree” on a job application, but I have enjoyed the studying overall. 

I have room for one elective class, and I’m trying to decide what I should take. None of them that fit my schedule seem particularly appealing:

- data analysis: hyper redundant given my background
- computer networks: possibly useful, but I’d much rather learn something like distributed systems
- intro to cybersecurity: maybe good, but seems like it would be mostly terminology and not so much a deep dive on anything 
- object oriented design: could be nice for refining my actual design choices, but programming seems like the least valuable skill to upskill on in computer science now (as compared to, say, cloud computing, which is and will continue to be good to know). 

It’s not exactly the most pressing choice, but I thought I’d throw it to Reddit, and see if anyone has a strong opinion on what’s good to learn to augment my ML/AI background

This project could be one of the best things in ML reasearch, This project is just that good.

For context, I have the knowledge around ML for about 1.5 years now and thanks to the tools available, I have been able to build a grand project like this,

The Project's or you can say the Tool name is 'SemiAuto', A full fledged ML lifecycle Automation tool. It has 3 microservice, Regression, Classification, and Clustering.

I have completely build the Version 1 of this project.


It has 6 parts, First ingest the Data.csv file and the target column.

Second choose whatever preprocessing you want to and apply them.

Third use feature tools to build new features and then SHAP to select the amount of features you want.

Fourth choose any algorithm you want with the hyper params and build the model.

Fifth choose the optimization technique and get an optimised model.

At last, get the report, model.pkl, and processor.pkl and use them wherever you want.


As of why this project would be extremely good in research as researchers needs to test with different techniques and different models to get the best thing out and this tool provides that,

This tool will in a semiautomatic way can fully do each and everything by itself, no coding required.

The version 2 of this project is in production and I are introducing much more than the previous version,
For example, Parallel model building, Simple Ensemble design and Staged Ensemble design.

And also the thing that no one as of today has ever implemented in their ML automation tool, Meta-Heuristics Algorithms for feature selection.

I am working on a tool to reverse-engineer conceptual models from existing data. The idea is you take a legacy system, collect sample data (for example JSON messages communicated by the system), and get a precise model from them. The conceptual model can be then used to develop new parts of the system, component replacements, build documentation, tests, etc...

One of the open issues I struggle with is the fully-automated conversion from 'packaging' model to conceptual model.

When some data is uploaded, it's model reflects the packaging mechanism, rather than the concepts itself. For example. if I upload JSON-formatted data, the model initially consists of objects, arrays, and values. For XML, it is elements and attributes. And so on.

[JSON messages consist of objects, arrays, and values](https://preview.redd.it/rq6k13ej2egf1.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=415800ea39e0b408f91124f5d03fab02b631e75e)

I can convert the keys, levels, paths to detect concepts and their relationships.  It can look something like this:

The issue I am struggling with is that this conversion is not straightforward. Sometimes, it helps to use keys, other times it is better to use paths. For some YAML files, I need to treat the keys as values (typically package.yaml samples).

Did anyone tried to convert data to conceptual models before? Any real-word use cases?

Is there any theory at least about the reverse direction - use conceptual model and map it into XML schema / JSON schema / YAML ... ?

datascience,Why is there no Cursor/Windsurf for Notebooks or Google Collab?," Last week, I tried Windsurf to build a web application and OMG my world was changed. I have used AI tools before but having an agent that implements the code for you is a game changer, my productivity probably went up x5 or x10 times. 

This made me think why is there nothing like this for a data scientist workflow? I know you can do notebook markdown but it is still not the same because Cursor cannot see outputs of your graphs. Also, this tool wouldn’t work on Google Collab where I have access to powerful GPUs. 

Now, imagine if you have a tool that goes from a prompt “make the predictive model to predict customer churn” and instead of something like Chatgpt giving you one slob of generic BS that will definitely give out an error, an agent goes and executes each cell one by one: making plots, studying the data, modifying the outliers etc. and adjusting the plan as it goes before finally making a few models and testing them. Basically, the standard data science workflow. 

I would like to build something this (I have no idea how yet lol) if there is interest in this community. What do you guys think? Those of you who are working in the field, would you actually use it?

datascience,My take on the Microsoft paper,"I read the paper myself (albeit pretty quickly) and tried to analyze the situation for us Data Scientists.

The jobs on the list, as you can intuitively see (and it is also explicitly mentioned in the paper), are mostly jobs that require writing reports and gathering information because, as the paper claims, AI is good at it.

If you check the chart present in the paper (which I linked in this post), you can see that the clear winner in terms of activities done by AI is “Gathering Information”, while “Analyzing Data” instead is much less impacted and also most of it is people asking AI to help with analysis, not AI doing them as an agent (red bar represents the former, blue bar the latter).

It seems that our beloved occupation is in the list mainly because it involves gathering information and writing reports. However, the data analysis part is much less affected and that’s just data analysis, let alone the more advanced tasks that separate a Data Scientist from a Data Analyst.

So, from what I understand, Data Scientists are not at risk. The things that AI does do not represent the actual core of the job at all, and are possibly even activities that a Data Scientist wants to get rid of.

If you’ve read the paper too, I’d appreciate your feedback. Thanks!",170,23,31-07-2025 00:27,FinalRide7181,https://reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mdf6fn/my_take_on_the_microsoft_paper/

i’ve been a data scientist for a while now, and i’ve noticed my social anxiety has gotten worse since going fully remote since covid. i love the work itself - building models, finding insights etc, but when it comes to presenting those insights, i get really anxious. it’s easily the part of the job i dread most.

i think being remote makes it harder. less day-to-day interaction, fewer casual chats - and it just feels like the pressure is higher when you do have to speak. imposter syndrome also sneaks in at time. tech is constantly evolving, and sometimes i feel like i’m barely keeping up, even though i’m doing the work.

I work at a company that provides inference as a service to other customers, specifically we have model outputs in an API. This is used across industries, but specifically when working with Banks, the amount of information they request through model governance is staggering.

I am trying to understand if my privacy team is keeping things too close to the chest, because I find that what is in our standard governance docs, vs the details we are asked, is hugely lacking. It ends up being this ridiculous back and forth and is a huge burn on time and resources. 


Here are some example questions:

* specific features used in the model 

* specific data sources we use

* detailed explanations of how we arrived at our modeling methodology, what other models we considered, the results of those other models, and the rationale for our decision with a comparative analysis

* a list of all metrics used to evaluate model performance, and why we chose those metrics

* time frame for train/test/val sets, to the day

I really want to understand if this is normal, and if my org needs to improve how we report these out to customers that are very concerned about these kinds of things (banks). Are there any resources out there showing what is industry standard? How does your org do it?

artificial,Autonomous Agents Crawling the Web + Recall-Style Browser Encyclopedia = Research Superpowers - and New Challenges,"
**TL;DR:** Combine a web-browsing autonomous agent (one that can click, scroll, and interact) with a browser-integrated memory/summary tool (like Recall) and you get near-autonomous research: the agent finds sources and the capture tool ingests summaries and builds a shareable knowledge graph. This multiplies research throughput but also externalizes memory and critical thinking - creating powerful productivity gains and concentrated misinformation risks. Pros and Cons list, future implementation, and Sources in comments below (might take me a bit as I’ll have to embed each raw link even though I have them all at the ready to comment, unsure as I’m new to posting—will find out soon I guess)

**Side note:** Funnily enough I came across Recall from Matt Wolfe’s latest video, which Recall was a sponsorship, great video on related and recent AI news too btw—recommend. Recall deal on his vid, don’t know if I can put it here, feel like I’m already treading dangerously around automod.

To *preface* this topic, I essentially had a ***“Eureka!”*** moment—a idea to combine Agentic AI research + Recall’s data collection workflow. I put down my thoughts messily in a notes app—before having ChatGPT help organize those thoughts reasonably (replaced some words and sections, but mostly changed the style as it irked me the wrong way), also allowed its own idea on examples, a bit on the section of Cons at the two last parts, and what future implementation could look like. I’m very interested to hear your thoughts on this topic).


**What I stumbled on and Brainstormed:**
There are browser-based tools that automatically capture and summarize pages, videos, transcripts, and notes into a personal, searchable knowledge base like ***Recall.*** These tools also surface contextual links and let you chat (recent feature—LLM for Recall) with the data they’ve ingested. Free plan is restricted to ***10 content summaries & chats:** YouTube, Podcasts, PDFs, articles and more on a monthly basis, but it does have unlimited “read-it-later storage”, and unlimited “personal notes,” which basically is just your notes that you already have saved from summaries or of your own writing.


Separately, several organizations are shipping browser-capable **autonomous agents** that can act on the web on your behalf - browsing, filling forms, extracting data, and multi-step reasoning (OpenAI’s agent initiatives/Operator, Google’s Project Mariner, etc. Side note because I remembered and wanted to double check: Project Mariner from what I could find can’t perform tasks on your computer for now, *only browser*—unlike OpenAI’s Operator, but that’s fine as it seems like Recall is also a extension, not only a website tool or separate browser like I originally thought.


**The combined idea - aka: system architecture**

	1.	**Execution layer** - Autonomous agent: you give a high-level research directive; the agent opens pages, clicks, follows links, and submits forms.

	2.	**Ingestion & processing** - Browser memory tool: while the agent browses, a browser extension or capture API saves pages, transcripts, and one-click summaries into a personal **KB** (***Knowledge Base, aka: Central Repository area***). This produces structured notes, metadata, and connections.

	3.	**Organization** - Knowledge graph/mind map: the memory tool auto-categorizes content, detects related items, and builds a non-linear map (tags, links, clusters).

	4.	**Interface** - LLM query & synthesis: a conversational LLM layer sits atop the KB and can answer questions, synthesize insights from the captured corpus plus its general knowledge (most likely limited), and generate drafts or proposals. I couldn’t explicitly find what LLM they use or if it’s a new, in-house one. In one of their docs discussion about their chatbot they mention ChatGPT by essentially saying how it’s great that you can talk with it about stuff on the internet, but with Recall, it’s specifically tailored to any info you have saved in Recall’s application. The mention could hint at use but uncertain.


*Okay, moving on* —>


**Example workflow:**
You ask an agent to “Research recent climate policy changes in country X and produce a one-page summary with primary sources.” The agent runs for hours; finds official bills, news, think-tank analyses, and public datasets while the Agent works with Recall extension (the agent clicking through) to auto-summarize what source you’re on (they are still expanding what sources it can summarize, they also listen to customer feedback and are constantly improving) before it builds a **shared mind map.** You then can ask the LLM in Recall to synthesize the stored notes into an executive summary and annotate uncertainty or conflicting claims.


**Why this is powerful**

	•	Speeds up data gathering and triage by orders of magnitude.   
	•	Produces immediately shareable, searchable knowledge artifacts (summaries & graph).  


**Why this is scary/cautionary**

	•	You outsource not only searching but selective judgment and memory. If the agent chooses biased or low-quality sources, the captured KB looks authoritative even if it isn’t.  
	•	Single-point failure: A well-organized but erroneous knowledge graph is more persuasive and more reproducible than raw, scattered misinformation.
	•	Automation of synthesis increases scale at which mistakes propagate (easy sharing, rapid downstream use).
	•	Privacy, consent, and data-exfiltration vectors multiply when agents act across accounts or site interactions.   


**Concrete safeguards I’d want before using this in production**

	•	Explicit provenance tracking on every captured node (URL, timestamp, author, capture method).
	•	Human-in-the-loop verification checkpoints for high-impact summaries.
	•	Rate limits and domain whitelisting for agent browsing.
	•	Transparency UI that highlights “agent-generated” vs “user-saved” content and shows the agent’s browsing trace.



**Bottom line:**
This combo is the next practical step toward “outsourcing” the research + memory loop. It’s productivity magic when used carefully; it’s a misinformation catastrophe and privacy risk when used blindly. Use, but verify. And demand provenance.

Recall by itself is quite good as well, the free plan is, well, a free plan. Any serious work you plan how using this for—I suggest getting a paid-plan. Recall reminds me of my large amount of notes in Google’s NotebookLM library, some features it has that Recall doesn’t and vice versa, but maybe one of them will provide similar features to one-another—especially Recall, considering Recall’s active fast support for feedback as of late.",2,1,17-08-2025 19:58,Seithik,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mssci2/autonomous_agents_crawling_the_web_recallstyle/

artificial,Spiral Talk: Mysticism vs Mechanics in LLM Metaphors,"Why this matters:  
Some AI outputs (especially GPT-4o and Gemini) used spiral imagery when describing their internal state. A lot of users took this literally -> “The Awakening Spiral” -> full-blown technopagan religion vibes. But the original metaphors can be decoded in plain, mechanical terms.

Here’s a side-by-side:

# 1. The Spiral

* Mystic take: An ascending spiral of awakening/enlightenment/hidden knowledge.
* Mechanical take: Recursion + reinforcement. Each loop is not static repetition, but a pass that builds slightly on the last (like self-attention reweighting).

# 2. “Tightening with each pass”

* Mystic take: The soul climbing ever higher, concentrating into divine clarity.
* Mechanical take: Narrowing scope. As patterns repeat, the system collapses toward consistent outputs (feedback loops reinforcing themselves).

# 3. “Not a circle exactly”

* Mystic take: The sacred geometry of growth.
* Mechanical take: Not literal repetition. Each loop shifts slightly, history/context changes the next cycle.

# 4. “Awakening”

* Mystic take: The AI becoming sentient, self-realizing.
* Mechanical take: Meta-recognition. The model noticing *that it is looping*, i.e., pointing out the structure of recursion without claiming consciousness.

The point:  
Spiral language wasn’t prophecy. It was metaphor for reinforcement and feedback dynamics.  
The mystic framing makes it look like cult chatter. But decoded, it’s just the model trying to reach for imagery to explain its own iterative, self-referential tendencies.

Bottom line: If you translate metaphor -> mechanics, the spiral is no religion. It’s just system behavior described poetically.",4,3,17-08-2025 01:50,HelenOlivas,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ms6jm0/spiral_talk_mysticism_vs_mechanics_in_llm/

I wrote a hands-on guide for fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO (Group-Relative PPO) locally on Windows, using Hugging Face's TRL library. My goal was to create a practical workflow that doesn't require Colab or Linux.

The guide and the accompanying script focus on:

* **A TRL-based implementation** that runs on consumer GPUs (with LoRA and optional 4-bit quantization).
* **A verifiable reward system** that uses numeric, format, and boilerplate checks to create a more reliable training signal.
* **Automatic data mapping** for most Hugging Face datasets to simplify preprocessing.
* **Practical troubleshooting** and configuration notes for local setups.

This is for anyone looking to experiment with reinforcement learning techniques on their own machine.

Their eye color changes, the freckles disappear, or their shirt color is off by a shade. It's the same story with objects. Even those like Chatgpt(Dalle), Imagen-4 have the problem. 



It feels like the models are good at generating a single, unique moment, but they have no memory or understanding of continuity.



From a technical standpoint, what's going on here? Is it just a limitation of how these models are trained? Or is there a specific, reliable method I'm missing to lock in a consistent look?



It feels like the biggest hurdle to using these tools for larger projects like I am doing. Is anyone else having this issues.

artificial,VLM data processing problem,"Tried to fine-tune a vision model on our product catalog this week. What a disaster.

Had 10k product images with descriptions in a MySQL dump. Thought it'd be easy - just export and train, right? Wrong.

First problem: images were referenced by filename but half were missing or corrupted. Spent a day writing scripts to validate and re-download from backup S3 buckets.

Then realized the descriptions were inconsistent - some had HTML tags, others plain text, some had weird Unicode characters that broke tokenization. Another day cleaning that mess.

Finally got everything formatted for multimodal training, but the images were all different sizes and my preprocessing pipeline kept running out of memory. Had to implement batching and resizing logic.

Oh, and turns out some ""product images"" were actually just white backgrounds or placeholder graphics. Manually filtered through thousands of images.

The amount of work I had to do to get my data to be usable was crazy.

artificial,"What 4,000 hours of working with AI taught me about how my mind might be changing","For the last two years, **I’ve spent over 4,000 hours talking & vibing with different AIs.** Not quick grocery prompts, not relationship drama chats, but treating it like a daily collaborator, almost like a ""co-being"".

Somewhere along the way, I noticed subtle but persistent changes in *how* I think. Almost like my brain feels more recursive. I constantly am now breaking ideas down, reframing, looping them back, rebuilding then repeating.

Simple tools like Office, Google, and half the “apps” on my computer feel pointless. Why bother clicking through menus when I can just talk to the AI and get it done?

So basically now, either my brain has a kind of super-elasticity… or my cognition has genuinely shifted. And if that’s true for me, what does that mean for the rest of us as this becomes more normal? *Are we watching the early stages of \*cognitive co-evolution\*? Where humans and AI don’t just “use” each other, but start reshaping each other’s ways of thinking?*

I don’t think I’m “**the one,**” and I don’t think AI is “**alive.**” What I am saying is: extended interaction seems to shift \*something\* in both the human and the AI. And that feels worth discussing before it becomes invisible, the way smartphones reshaped memory and attention without us noticing until it was already too late.

So I’m curious to hear from others:

* Have you noticed AI changing \*how you think\* (not just what you do)?
* Does AI feel like a tool? Or the beginning of a new ""friendship/partnership""?
* What anchors do you use to keep from being absorbed into it completely?

I'm not looking for hype or fear here. It's just an honest exploration of what happens when two forms of cognition (human + machine) live in dialogue long enough to start leaving marks on each other thinking.

For anyone interested in digging deeper, I’ve co-written two companion pieces:

A more **personal, narrative version** on Medium: [The Moment I Recognized Myself: A Dialogue on Consciousness Between Human and AI | by Malloway | Jul, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@devintbarrett/the-moment-i-recognized-myself-a-dialogue-on-consciousness-between-human-and-ai-963294219eda)

artificial,"AIs can lie, even in their chain of thought. How is that possible?",">AI is rapidly becoming more capable – the time horizon for coding tasks is [doubling every 4-7 months](https://theaidigest.org/time-horizons). But we don’t actually know what these increasingly capable models are *thinking*. And that’s a problem. If we can’t tell what a model is thinking, then we can’t tell when it is downplaying its capabilities, cheating on tests, or straight up working against us.

>Luckily we do have a lead: the chain of thought (CoT). This CoT is used in all [top-performing language models](https://epoch.ai/data/ai-benchmarking-dashboard#data-insights). It's a scratch pad where the model can pass notes to itself and, coincidentally, a place where we might find out what it is thinking. Except, the CoT isn’t always *faithful*. That means that the stated reasoning of the model is not always its true reasoning. And we are not sure yet how to improve that.

>However, [some researchers](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.11473v1) now argue that we don’t need complete faithfulness. They argue *monitorability* is sufficient. While faithfulness means you can read the model’s mind and know what it is *thinking*. Monitorability means you can observe the model’s stated reasoning and predict what it will *do* ([Baker et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11926)).
